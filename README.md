Basic inventory management system using TypeScript. The system should be able to add items, remove items, and list all items in the inventory.
This exercise will help you understand basic TypeScript concepts, including interfaces, classes, and basic array manipulations. Feel free to expand the functionality by adding more features, such as updating item quantities or finding items by name.
